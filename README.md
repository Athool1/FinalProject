#Campus Smart Café Java Application (Solo Project)

Tools Used: Core Java, Swings(UI/Frontend), JDK 1.7, Netbeans, Oracle 11g(Database/Backend), JDBC connector 

Description: Implemented an app CampusSmartCafe which maintains a number of restaurants/cafes and vending machines all over campus. A card user may use any of the cafes or vending machines to enter (and store) her/his choices, order food, know the calorie content and keep track of his/her expenses. CampusSmartCafe (CSC) is a computer-based application that is a simulation of how Campus Cafes work on campus. The functionality of the application is described briefly below:

•	Display a Campus Map: Display a Campus map showing the location of the cafes, food stores and vending machines on campus.

•	Select a café: A card-user selects a café by pointing and clicking on its location on the map. The selection opens up a window with options to buy/order food, enter preferences and/or view expenses.

•	Enter preferences: A user can enter food preferences and/or available funds.

•	Food preferences:  Food preferences can range from daily caloric requirements/restrictions or preference for specific needs such as low sodium, low sugar items etc. A user can enter the daily calorie intake that should be monitored. The saved preferences for a user are available from any restaurant or a vending machine on campus.

•	Available Funds: A user can enter an amount for the available funds (for a month, for example). Every time she/he buys a food item, the purchase amount is subtracted from the available funds.

•	View Dietary profile: A user can select to view his/her dietary profile. A dietary profile uses the food preferences (user preferences for number of calories per day, for example) entered earlier by the user. Whenever the user buys an item, the item’s calories are entered into the profile. The profile shows the user preference (for calories), number spent and the amount left.

•	View Expenses: A user can select to view his/her expense profile. An expense profile uses an amount for funds (by month) entered earlier by the user. Whenever the user buys an item, the funds are adjusted monthly. 

•	Buy Food (via a vending machine): Using the available food choices displayed on the vending machine, the user selects the item, inserts the card (or enters the card number and password) and the item is dispensed; the user’s caloric and expense profile is updated.

•	Order food: Using the available cafes on campus, the user selects an item(s) from a specific cafe, inserts the card (or enters the card number and password) and a message is shown as to where and when the item would be ready for either pick-up or eat-in.  The user’s caloric and expense profile is updated.
